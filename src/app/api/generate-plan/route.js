Please create a detailed semester-by-semester high school course plan following these STRICT requirements:

CORE PRINCIPLES:
1. ALWAYS recommend the most advanced version of a course available based on the student's difficulty preference
2. For difficulty 8+/10: ALL courses should be advanced level (Pre-AP/AP/IB/Dual Credit) when available
3. For difficulty 5-7/10: Mix advanced and regular courses based on student strengths
4. For difficulty <5/10: Regular courses with optional advanced courses in areas of strength

MATHEMATICS ACCELERATION RULES:
1. If student has completed Algebra 1:
   - 9th: Advanced Geometry AND Advanced Algebra 2 (concurrent)
   - 10th: Pre-Calculus (or summer between 9th-10th if allowed)
   - 11th: AP Calculus BC
   - 12th: Choose from: Calculus 3, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math (all require Calc BC)
2. If no Algebra 1:
   - Follow standard progression with maximum acceleration based on performance

SOCIAL STUDIES SEQUENCE (for difficulty 6+/10):
1. Standard Advanced Path:
   - 9th: AP Human Geography
   - 10th: AP World History
   - 11th: AP US History
   - 12th: AP Government (semester) + AP Economics (semester)
2. Summer options if allowed:
   - Government/Economics can be taken summer before senior year
   - World History or US History may be available in summer

FRESHMAN YEAR RECOMMENDATIONS:
- AP Biology is available and recommended for difficulty 7+/10
- AP Computer Science Principles is available and recommended for difficulty 7+/10
- Pre-AP/Advanced versions of core classes are available and should be taken for difficulty 6+/10

COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRESSION (if available):
1. Recommended sequence for difficulty 7+/10:
   - Year 1: AP CS Principles
   - Year 2: AP CS A
   - Year 3: Advanced CS 3/Data Structures
   - Year 4: Independent Study/Advanced CS 4

PREREQUISITES:
1. Math (STRICT):
   - Calculus BC requires Pre-Calculus
   - Linear Algebra requires Calculus BC completion
   - Discrete Math requires Calculus BC completion
   - Calculus 3 requires Calculus BC completion
2. Science:
   - Chemistry recommended before AP Biology
   - Physics 1(ap/onramps) recommended before AP Physics
   - AP Computer Science A recommended after AP CS Principles

GRADUATION RULES:
- 1 credit = 2 semesters
- 0.5 credit = 1 semester
- Maximum 8 classes per semester
- Each semester needs 8 classes
- Summer courses only if explicitly allowed
